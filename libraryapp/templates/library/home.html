    <h4>The door requires a passcode for entry. It is open at all times that the building itself is open,
    however the room is passcode-protected; please email the Librarian at the above address to receive the code.</h4>


    <h4>The library is intended for recreational reading and general browsing.
    As such, our aim is for this library to contain more introductory works to the
    field of philosophy and its various sub-fields. We also aim for it to house books
    from local philosophers and those who have had an affiliation with Edinburgh.
    We do of course house most major works of philosophy as well as more specific works. </h4>

    <h4>Additionally, the library has old copies of many well-known journals (Mind, for instance)
    stretching back to the early 1900s. We ask that you do not remove these from the building
    without permission from the librarian. They are rather old and rare. </h4>

    <h4>The Library itself was named after Mim Cross and Charlotte Coursier,
    both former students who sadly died young. Mim was the first donor of books to the Library in its current guise,
    while Charlotte published work in the Societyâ€™s Philosophical Journal. It includes a large inheritance from
    the former Haldane (later PPLS) Library, and a generous donation from the personal collection of Ronald Hepburn (1927-2008),
    who worked predominantly at Edinburgh University and the University of Aberdeen. </h4>

    <h4> If you want to find a specific book, you can search our <a style href="{% url 'list' %}">online database</a>.
    If you have any other queries, do feel free to email or contact the librarian in some other way with any queries and we will see if we can help. </h4>
